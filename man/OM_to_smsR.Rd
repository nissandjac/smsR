\title{Turn an operating model into smsR-ready inputs}
\usage{
OM_to_smsR(OM, df, recmodel = 1, MCV = NULL, M_max = max(df$age))
}
\arguments{
\item{OM}{list
Operating model output. Must include at least:
- `survey` : array or list of survey observations (dimensions must align with
  `nage × nyear × nseason`, or be coercible).
- `CatchN.save.age` : 4D array of catch-at-age numbers with dimensions
  `[age, year, season, space]`; smsR uses the first spatial stratum
  (i.e. `[..., , , 1]`).}

\item{df}{list
Operating-model/meta parameters required for shaping inputs; must include:
- `nyear` (integer): number of years.
- `nage` (integer): number of ages.
- `nseason` (integer): number of seasons (quarters).
- `logSDcatch` (numeric, log-scale): catch observation SD used when adding
  lognormal noise (see Details). May be length-1 or length-`nage`.}

\item{recmodel}{integer(1)
Recruitment model code for **estimation** in smsR. Typical choices:
- `0` = none/fixed,
- `1` = Beverton-Holt,
- `2` = Ricker.
(Adjust if your package uses different codes.)}

\item{MCV}{integer or NULL
Optional grouping index for natural mortality (**M**) by age (e.g.,
a vector of length `nage` mapping ages to M groups). Use `NULL` to
treat ages independently.}

\item{M_max}{numeric(1)
Upper bound used when defining priors/penalties on natural mortality.
Defaults to `max(df$age)` if available (adapt to your convention).}
}
\value{
list
  A named list ready for smsR, typically including:
  - `Catchobs` : `array[nage, nyear, nseason]` catch-at-age numbers.
  - `Catchobs_err` : same shape as `Catchobs`, with optional lognormal noise.
  - `Surveyobs` : survey observations aligned to `nage × nyear × nseason`.
  - `recmodel`, `MCV`, `M_max` : passed-through control parameters.
  Additional elements may be included as needed by smsR.
}
\description{
Helper that reshapes/sanitizes outputs from an operating model (**OM**) into
a compact list of arrays and options consumed by **smsR**. It builds quarter-
level catch and survey inputs and (optionally) perturbs catch with lognormal
noise using `df$logSDcatch`.
}
\details{
**Catch noise:** If `df$logSDcatch` is provided, `Catchobs_err` is formed as
`Catchobs * exp(ε)`, where `ε ~ N(0, sd = exp(df$logSDcatch))`. If
`logSDcatch` is length-`nage`, age-specific noise is applied per year/season.

**Dimensionality:** `CatchN.save.age` is expected as
`[age = df$nage, year = df$nyear, season = df$nseason, space >= 1]`. The
function uses the first spatial dimension. `Surveyobs` must be conformable to
`nage × nyear × nseason`; otherwise, provide a coercible structure.

                          dim = c(df$nage, df$nyear, df$nseason, 1))
