\title{Forecast an smsR Operating Model (OM)}
\usage{
forecast_op(
  df,
  Ninit,
  nyear = 2,
  Fnew = matrix(0.2, nrow = df$nseason, ncol = nyear),
  env_new = NULL,
  stochastic = FALSE,
  seed = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{List containing historical OM parameters (e.g., mortality, selectivity, maturity).}

\item{Ninit}{Numeric vector. Numbers-at-age in the last year of the historical OM (used to initialize forecast).}

\item{nyear}{Integer. Number of years to forecast.}

\item{Fnew}{Numeric or vector. Fishing mortality to apply in the forecast years.}

\item{env_new}{Optional environmental input(s) used in forecasting (e.g., temperature, productivity).}

\item{stochastic}{Logical. Should recruitment deviations be stochastic? Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{seed}{Optional integer. Random seed for reproducibility if \code{stochastic = TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A list containing forecasted operating model outputs, such as numbers-at-age, SSB, recruitment, and catch.
}
\description{
Simulates future population dynamics using the operating model for a given number of years.
Commonly used in Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE) frameworks.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Forecast 10 years with fixed F
out <- forecast_om(df = om_data, nyear = 10, Fnew = 0.2, Ninit = N_last_year)

# Forecast with stochastic recruitment and environmental input
out <- forecast_om(df = om_data, nyear = 20, Fnew = rep(0.2, 20),
                   env_new = env_proj, Ninit = N_last_year,
                   stochastic = TRUE, seed = 123)
}
