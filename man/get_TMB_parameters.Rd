\value{
A list containing all required input data for the smsR model.
}
\description{
This function prepares the necessary input data for an `smsR` model.
 Required input are `mtrx`, `Surveyobs`,`Catchobs`, and `year`.
 Note that the dimensions of the input data needs to be consistent with year, season and ages.
}
\details{
The required inputs include:
  - `mtrx`: A matrix containing life history parameters (i.e,, `weca`, `west`, `mat`, `M`).
  - `Catchobs`: A matrix of observed catch numbers at age.
  - `Surveyobs`: A matrix of observed survey numbers at age.

Additionally, the user must specify the `years` corresponding to the input data.
